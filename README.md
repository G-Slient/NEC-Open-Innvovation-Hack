# "Enhanced Customer Experience Powered by AI".

 Improving the CX experience in retail stores using Machine Learning.

## Solution

* We have built an app for self check out by using Qr code scanner in the app to scan and add the items into the cart.
* We have used machine learning for providing recommendations to the customers based the purchase history and association rules.
* Once the items are added into the cart, the customer can do the payment using different payment methods.
